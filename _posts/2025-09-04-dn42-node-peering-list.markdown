Welcome, all dn42 people who are interested in peering with me, AS4242423797!

This page will temporary serve as a node directory where I have server presence there. I'll make a better page when I have a nice landing page (if I stopped procastinating, that is ðŸ˜…).

## Desired peering requirements

- Latency should be <=20ms
- Have a public WireGuard endpoint to connect (if you don't have this, it's fine)
- BFD is configured (again, if you don't have this, it's also fine)
- MP-BGP with Extended next hop (IPv4-over-IPv6)

## Node directory

(Region code: `<country>-<nearest airport><identifier num>`, region code can be reassigned to different servers)

| Server code | Region code | Endpoint                   | IPv4 | IPv6   | Notes                                                              |
